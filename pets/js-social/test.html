    <div class="title">Dietary Guidelines for Alcohol</div>
    <div class="desc">Alcohol consumption is associated with a variety of short- and long-term health risks, including
        motor vehicle crashes, violence, sexual risk behaviors, high blood pressure, and various cancers (e.g., breast
        cancer). The risk of these harms increases with the amount of alcohol you drink. For some conditions, like some
        cancers, the risk increases even at very low levels of alcohol consumption (less than1 drink). To reduce the
        risk of alcohol-related harms, the 2015-2020 U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that if alcohol is
        consumed, it should be consumed in moderation—up to one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for
        men—and only by adults of legal drinking age. This is not intended as an average over several days, but rather
        the amount consumed on any single day. The Guidelines also do not recommend that individuals who do not drink
        alcohol start drinking for any reason. Two in three adult drinkers report drinking above moderate levels at
        least once a month.</div>
