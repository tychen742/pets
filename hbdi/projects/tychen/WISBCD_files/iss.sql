That includes user accounts, applications, and systems tools such as the web server and database systems.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p> One of the challenges we have in this course is that you are scripting and managing data remotely through a Windows RDP (yes, our Linux VMs are on a Windows server) and then the encrypted network protocol Secure Shell (SSH) to handle the VM server operations.  This added security measure means you can not run SSH from your PC anymore, and it adds an additional level of complexity to our management and use of the systems that you have the opportunity to understand and master.  So, following instructions carefully, documenting the changes you make, Google a lot, and learn from our mistakes is very important. </p>\r\n\r\n<p> This lab will cover some basics of Linux account, file, and content management.  The tasks you need to accomplish in this lab are described below: </p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> Create the user accounts you will use later on and record their passwords in a secure location (assignment a00 on Canvas).  \r\n<li> Create the directories and directory structure needed for this class.\r\n<li> Configure your group\'s web server so it works in the cci.local domain.\r\n<li> Create and test a per-user directory web page.\r\n<li> Expand the website using content from another computer.\r\n<li> Create, document and save an archive of the expanded website.\r\n<li> Manipulate text streams using output redirection operators </ol>\r\n\r\n<p>To do any of this, you will need to access the virtual machine (VM) assigned to you using Secure Shell (SSH).  The secure shell application can be accessed using your FSUID and password from any Mac, Linux or Windows machine via the Remote Labs (https://labs.cci.fsu.edu) webpage. </p> ', '', '', '', '', 0),

But, you can do it, with or without the help from people around you, and Google. \r\n<li> # To create aliases, we use the alias command with a syntax of <c>alias  aliasName=\"your custom command here\"</c>.  Note that aliases give us a way of <b>customizing commands</b> as we want. \r\n<li> You will practice aliases and environment variables more later in other assignments and it will make better sense over time why these features are useful.  \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul id=check>\r\n<li><p> Create a file called q02.sh that defines the alias, function and environment variables with the names given below:\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ol class = \"upper_case\">\r\n<li>	\r\n<ul id=check>\r\n<li>Create an <b>alias</b> with the name called <b>accounts</b>:  \r\n</ul>\r\nThis alias should display all the user accounts on your computer system by showing the files (directories) in the root home (/home) directory.\r\n<li id=none> ### note that it\'s a common practice to put your alias definitions in ~/.bashrc (or ~/.bash_aliases as suggested in Ubuntu) so they are made available next time your start a shell session because ~/.bashrc will be <c>source</c>d when the shell starts.  \r\n\r\n<li>	\r\n<ul id=check>\r\n<li>Create a <b>function</b> with the name called <b>extract</b>: \r\n</ul>\r\nThis function should extract the files from a compressed tar file named a0<i>X</i>.tar.gz (where <i>X</i> is an integer number provided to the function as position parameter).  Running this function should extract the files and send (redirect) a list of the names of the extracted files to a file called t<i>X</i>.txt.  \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><pre><c>extract 1</c></pre> (run either in a form of function call in script or command line command after sourcing) <br>\r\nwill extract the content from a01.tar.gz and redirect the names of the files extracted into t1.txt (### note that here we are not interested in the files extracted from the tar file (<c>tar -xf <i>tar_file_name</i></c>, as we usually do).  Instead, we are interested in the names of the files.  In this sense, we need the tar option <c>-v</c> (erbose) because it gives us the names of the files (including directories) being extracted from the tar.  You have seen <c>-v</c> been demonstrated a couple of times before, now it\'s time to put it into action!)  \r\n<li><pre><c>extract 3</c> </pre>\r\nwill extract the content from a03.tar.gz and put the names of the files extracted into t3.txt through redirection.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<li>\r\n<ul id=check>\r\n<li>	Create a second <b>function</b> called <b>cleanup</b> that:\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>	removes the t<i>X</i>.txt files and \r\n<li>	removes the a0<i>X</i> directory and its content created by the extract function above.\r\n<li id=none> ### note that a Bash function can take two formats:\r\n<pre>\r\nfunction function_name {\r\n[commands... ]\r\n}\r\n</pre> \r\nor \r\n<pre>\r\nfunction_name {\r\n[commands... ]\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n<li id=none> ### also note that a function can return or not return a value to the caller.\r\n<li id=none> <c>rm</c> (remove files and directories) should work better than <c>rmdir</c> here because rmdir only removes empty directories.

You can make function calls in script and it will work.  The environment variables and aliases, however, will not be available to you because when a script runs, it works as a shell session and all variables local in the session will not be passed to other sessions when the script finishes running.

The reason we are denied of running it, however, is because we don\'t have proper permissions as the error message says.  \r\n\r\n<p> Now let us take a closer look at the problem.  We will use <c>ls -l</c> because the <c>-l</c> long listing format option will modify the behavior of <c>ls</c> to include the permisison information we need: \r\n<pre>\r\nchen_user@vma50:~/class/a02/q01$ ls -l solution.pl \r\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 chen_user chen_user 1490 Aug 21  2017 solution.pl\r\nchen_user@vma50:~/class/a02/q01$  </pre>\r\n\r\n<p> We are interested in the field before the first space in the entry (it\'s called \"file mode string\" or \"mode bits\" as defined by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX\">POSIX</a>) in the list: <span class=\"inline\">?UUUGGGOOOS</span>.  \r\nThe first character in the file mode string denotes denotes the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_file_types\">file type</a>: <b>d</b> (directory), <b>l</b> (link), or <b>-</b> (file).  The UUUGGGOOOO (<u>U</u>ser, <u>G</u>roup, <u>O</u>ther) bits follows the file type defines the permission of the three types of users, each with Read, Write, and eXecute (or search for directories) permission.  In our example of <c>ls -l solution.pl</c>, the file mode string is read like this:  </p>\r\n\r\n<table id=\"tbl_regular\">\r\n<thead> <tr> <td> </td> <td> file owner </td>    <td> group owner </td>    <td> others </td> </tr></thead>\r\n<tbody> \r\n<tr>  <td>symbolic notaiton </td><td>  rw- </td>    <td> rw- </td>    <td> r-- </td>      </tr>\r\n<tr> <td> meaning </td> <td> read, write </td>  <td> read, write </td>  <td> read </td> </tr>  \r\n<tr> <td><a href=\"http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0090.php\">numeric notation</a></td> <td> 6 (4+2+0) </td> <td> 6 (4+2+0) </d> <td> 4 (4+0+0) </d> </tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p> No wonder we are not able to execute the script.  We are permitted to read and write only.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4> 1.2 Modify file permissions </h4>\r\n<ul><li> If you mess up the permissions, you can run the script <c>clean01.sh</c> by typing <c>./clean01.sh</c> to remove the execute permssion of solution.pl and decode.sh. </ul>\r\n<p> We don\'t like getting denied, so now we want to gain execute permission to the file.  We do so by changing the file mode string and the command is, as you have guessed: <c>chmod</c> (change mode).  The syntax of chmod command is: <span class=\"inline\">chmod [options] permissions file_name</span> and can be issued using both symbolic or numeric notations.  For example, in your company, you are working on a file and you want to set the permission as <a href=\"https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uchmod.htm\">such</a>: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li> the user can read, write, and execute it;\r\n<li> members of your group can read and execute it; and\r\n<li> others may only read it. </ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Using the symbolic notation, you would issue the command as:\r\n<p><c>chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r myfile</c> (no space after commas);  or, in numeric form:\r\n<p><c>chmod 754 myfile </c>\r\n<p> Now you know why people say numbers such 777, 660, 640 when they talk about access policy.  \r\n<p> Note that managing permissions is a serious issue and you want to be very careful by having a clearly stated access policy and always documenting each step as you modify them (especially, e.g., with something like the <c>-R</c> recursive option).  For example, you may issue <c>chmod go-rw foo.txt</c> and just strip the read and write permission for both the file owner group and all others (because we used the <c>-</c> option rather than <c>+</c>). \r\n \r\n<p> For a simpler scenario like this assignment, we could simply issue a command like <c>chmod +x <i>script.sh</i></c> to grant execute permission to all user groups.  \r\n\r\n<p> With what we have learned about file permissions, you may now perform the following actions to the script file <c>solution.pl</c>: \r\n<ul><ul class=\"check\">\r\n<li>	Use <c>ls â€“l</c> to view the permissions for the file.\r\n<li> Use <c>chmod</c> command to grant execute permission to all user groups. \r\n<li>	Use <c>ls â€“l</c> to view the permissions for the file again to make sure the <c>x</c> bits are present.\r\n<p> After you are confident that the file permission has been modified the way you want, \r\n<li>	try the command <c>./solution.pl  hello</c> \r\nIt should work and give you the result like this:\r\n<pre>\r\nchen_user@vma50:~/class/a02/q01$ ./solution.pl hello\r\n\r\nHELLO THERE\r\nchen_user@vma50:~/class/a02/q01$ </pre>\r\n    <li> Run <c>solution.pl</c> with <b>quick</b> as argument and observe the result.\r\n    <li> Run <c>solution.pl</c> with <b>fsu</b> as argument and observe the result.\r\n\r\n<p> Now, let\'s grant execute permission to the file <c>decode</c>: \r\n<li>	Use <c>chmod +x</c> to make decode.sh executable and\r\n<li>  Run the command ./decode.sh.

We will learn how to customize our system by: \r\n<ol> \r\n<li> Creating bin directory: Create your own bin (binary) directory to make running executable files a lot easier. \r\n<li> Updating the $PATH environment variables to enable the new bin directory. \r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Use the directory ~/class/a02/q02 complete this part of the lab and to record your answers for this part of the assignment.) </ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4> 2.1 $PATH and bin directories </h4>\r\n<p> For security reasons, after we modify the permission mode of a text file to become executable (<c>chomd</c>), we need run the executable script like: <c>./<i>script.sh</i></c>.  This is okay for now, but we can imagine that we may write some executables that we want to run the same sequence of commands when we are in different paths in the system (or even run by different users).  We can either\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> soft-link (<c>ln -s</c>) to the file wherever we want to run it, or \r\n<li> place the file in a <b>bin</b> directory that contains compiled binary files and executable scripts to be run from different directory locations in the system. </ul>\r\n\r\nThe dot (<c>.</c>) in <c>./<i>script.sh</i></c> we place in front of the script is needed because the executable is not a built-in command (either shell built-in or system utility).  For security reasons, Unix only runs the executables if the directory the files are in is specified in the <b>PATH environment variable</b>.  If you run <c>echo $PATH</c>, you will see the directories in the PATH variable like this:\r\n<pre>\r\nchen_user@vma50:~$ echo $PATH\r\n/home/chen_user/bin:/home/chen_user/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:\r\n/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin\r\nchen_user@vma50:~$ \r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p> As you can see, there are several (<b>bin</b>) directories (bin stands for binary; meaning compiled executable file) with <c>:</c> as separator.  When we run an executable command or script, the Unix system walks through these folders and if the command is in one of these directories, the system executes the command.  The <c>./</c> in front of the script (or using a full pathname), therefore, is used instead to instruct the operating system that we do want to run this executable in the present working directory, which is not in $PATH.  \r\n\r\n<p> If we created some executable scripts that we want to run across the system, we can either:\r\n    <ul>\r\n    <li> place them into one of the directories in the $PATH environment variable, or \r\n    <li> add the containing directory into the $PATH variable. \r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us create a user bin and place the executable decode.sh into it, then update $PATH include the user bin directory:\r\n<ul><ul id=\"check\">\r\n    <li> Navigate to your user home directory;\r\n    <li> Create the <span class=\"inline\">/home/username/bin</span>, or <span class=\"inline\">~/bin</span>, directory.  \r\n    <li> <c>cp</c> decode.sh from q01/ to your ~/bin directory.  \r\n</ul></ul>\r\n\r\n<h4> 2.2 Update the PATH Environment Variable </h4> \r\n<p> Environment variables are \r\n  <p> We use the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13795237/what-does-the-export-command-do\"><c>export</c></a> command to mark environment variables to be <b>exported</b> to all processes started from the current shell session so they can be accessed by the subshells.

If you use an IDE, the compiling and running are usually done as part of the IDE interface.\r\n\r\n<li> \"hello world\" in bash </li>\r\n<p> In Bash and other shell languages, programmers take advantage of the existing tools (commands and utilities) in the OS.  Actually, the term \"shell\" began as a name for a \"<a href=\"https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/14934/why-was-the-word-shell-used-to-descibe-a-command-line-interface\">command processor</a>\" and a shell is both an interface to the OS (a CLI as opposed to GUI) and a <a href=\"http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/\">command language interpreter</a> that helps us run scripts.

We can use a text editor for this purpose by running\r\n<pre>\r\nchen_user@vma50:~$ nano hello_world\r\n</pre>\r\nto open nano and insert the <b>same command</b> inside the text document:\r\n<pre>\r\necho \"hello, world\"\r\n</pre>\r\n<p> Save the file, make it executable (<c>chmod</c>) as this is still a text file, and run it like this:\r\n<pre>\r\nchen_user@vma50:~$ chmod +x hello_world \r\nchen_user@vma50:~$ ./hello_world \r\nhello, world\r\nchen_user@vma50:~$</pre>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4> 3.1 Running Scripts (Redirecting Text Stream) </h4>\r\n<p> We want to: \r\n<ul><li> Observe a script to learn how a script can look like, and \r\n<li> Run some user-created scripts to generate text streams and redirect the data to files, which we practiced a little in Lab 01 (a01) already.  As opposed to running Unix utilities or Bash commands one by one in the command line, scripts can contain multiple commands in a sequence. </ul>\r\n\r\n<p> Use the directory ~/class/a02/q03 to complete this part of the lab and to record your answers for this part of the assignment.\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"upper_case\">\r\n\r\n<li> Observe and run simple.sh </>\r\n<p> Here we want to run the script simple.sh and redirect the output to simple.txt, but let us take a peek inside the script: \r\n<pre>\r\nchen_user@vma50:~/class/a02/q03$ cat simple.sh \r\n<span style=\"color: #FF5733;\">#!/bin/bash</span>\r\n<span style=\"color: blue; \">#</span>\r\n<span style=\"color: blue; \">#</span>  Script used to print information about this computer\r\n<span style=\"color: blue; \">#</span>\r\necho \"STARTING $0\"\r\necho \"Script    : $0\"\r\necho \"User      : $USER\"\r\necho \"Home      : $HOME\"\r\necho \"Directory : `pwd`\"\r\necho \"Date      : `date`\"\r\necho \"===========================================\"\r\necho\r\necho \"Users currently logged are : \" \r\nw | cut -d \" \" -f 1 - | grep -v USER | sort -u\r\necho\r\necho \"This is `uname -s` running on a `uname -m` processor.\"\r\necho\r\necho \"The system has been up for this long :`uptime`\"\r\necho\r\necho \"There are `ps -a | wc -l` processes running\"\r\necho\r\necho \"===========================================\"\r\necho\r\necho \"ENDING $0\"\r\n\r\nchen_user@vma50:~/class/a02/q03$\r\n</pre>\r\n<p> We see that there are a lot of <c>echo</c>\'s in this script and it looks quite \"flat\" comparing to, e.g., Java source code.  Some of the obvious elements:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> <span style=\"color: #FF5733;\">#!/bin/bash</span>: The first line include: </li>\r\n    <ul id=\"circle\">\r\n    <li>the <b>shebang</b> (<c>#!</c>) to instruct the OS that this <b>text</b> file is actually a script, and \r\n    <li>the interpreter directive (/bin/bash) to point to the interpreter to be used for this script.  In this case, we use bash as our interpreter, which is located in /bin directory for binary files: \r\n<pre>\r\nchen_user@vma50:/bin$ ls -l bash\r\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1037528 May 16  2017 bash\r\nchen_user@vma50:/bin$  \r\n</pre>  </ul>\r\n\r\n<li> <span style=\"color: blue; \">#</span>: The number sign # is a single line comment simbol. There is no multi-line comment in bash.  The comment symbol and all the following characters in the same line are ignored by the interpreter.  \r\n<li> <c>echo</c>: the <c>echo</c> command display text by printing the text to terminal (standard ouput, STDOUT).  Note that double quotes <c>\"</c> are used around text string. \r\n<li> <c>w</c>: the <c>w</c> command that shows what users are logged in. \r\n<li> <c>$</c>: A dollar sign (<c>$</c>) before a character string is a prefix for accessing the variable.  A variable can be assigned a value.  In other words, a variable is a pointer to a value.  In shell scrypting we use environment variables and shell variables. \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<li> Run simple.sh\r\n<p> We want to run simple.sh and redirect the results to a text file simple.txt.\r\n<ul class=\"check\">\r\n<li> Run <c>./simple.sh</c> to observe the output of the file in shell. \r\n<li> Run <c>./simple.sh > simple.txt</c> to redirect the output to simple.txt instead of STDOUT.\r\n<li> Use <c>ls -l</c> to make sure simple.txt is created and the timestamp is current. \r\n<pre>-rw-rw-r-- 1 chen_user chen_user  514 Jan 16 19:11 simple.txt</pre> \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<li> Run pinger.sh </li>\r\n<p>Using the script pinger.sh, we want to find active computers on your network using the <c>ping</c> command.

You should note that these hosts are in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network\">private network</a> and have IP address of 192.168.xxx.xxx.\r\n <p> Let us do the following:\r\n<ul class=\"check\">\r\n     <li> Run the script <c>pinger.sh</c> without data redirection to observe how this script scans the range of hosts and output to the terminal.

(Note that because we use the overwrite redirection operator <c>></c> before the appended redirection operators <c>>></c>, no matter how many times we run pinger.sh, we will have a fresh copy of whoami.txt because each time we run pinger.sh, whoami.txt is overwritten.)\r\n\r\n<li>  Finally, run <c>pinger.sh > pinger.txt</c>.  This time, you should not see the output to terminal. \r\n<li> If itâ€™s not tested, it doesnâ€™t work.  Make sure you have actually created two output files: pinger.txt and whoami.txt.

In this assignment, we will learn some common practices of how Linux system administrators customize their Linux environment to make their life easier.  The skills and concepts you learn from this activity will help you see from the perspective of information systems administration.  Such an experience can be proof that you have the foundational knowledge of Linux systems and shell, which assures your employer that you are comfortable with the technical aspects of the job you are seeking.\r\n \r\n<p> Your personal environment is loaded when you log into a computer (when the default configurations are read from various configuration files and executed).  You have some control over what goes into your environment via modifying the configurations in the files such as <b>~/.bashrc</b>, <b>~/.profile</b>, and <b>~/.bash_aliases</b>.  In this activity, we will modify that configuration by creating an additional file specifically to expand the Linux environment for this assignment.  To do this we must:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>	Create the directories and scripts needed to implement our new tools,\r\n<li>	Create a script to catch user input and perform file scanning,\r\n<li>	Create a script to redirect command results into specified logs, \r\n<li>	Create a file ~/myenv to hold the commands that create our assignment-specific environment variables and aliases, and \r\n<li>	Create the ./.bash_aliases file and modify it to include the file, ~/myenv; and finally, we will\r\n<li>	Verify that everything works as designed. </ol>\r\n\r\n<p> To prepare for this activity, you will need to create two directories called <b>tmp</b> and <b>backup</b> in your home directory.

This script can be modified to check for a specific file or directory in every userâ€™s home directory, which is a common administrative task to perform.  For example, finder_v00.sh can be used to see if all of the users have set up a backup, class, public_html, tmp, or bin directory.  Using a script like finder_v00.sh, an administrator can automatically check the status of the user accounts in batch.  \r\n\r\n<li> Backup first:    \r\n    <p> To accomplish this, the finder_v00.sh script needs to be modified.  But we don\'t usually modify files directly; instead, we make sure we have two copies of the file: a backup copy and a working copy.  We make modifications on the working copy only, so we always have the original file to fall back to in case the task does not go as planned.  In other words, we will at least not make things worse. \r\n\r\n<li>	Tile two terminals: \r\n    <p> It is often useful to open two terminal windows, one for editing and one for testing your code.  Tile the terminal windows in large enough size so you can see the chunks and structure of the scripts, which gives you a better idea about the logic of your code blocks (paragraphs).

By default, Microsoft Word automatically keeps a copy of your file every <a href=\"https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001288.htm\">10 minutes</a>, which is probably a good indicator of how much time your clients and you can tolerate a loss of work in case of a technical issue).

This may seem trivial, but it could save a day when things get hectic and you don\'t even know if you could rely on the timestamps (use <c>ls -l</c> to see) to tell which file(s) are the working file.  So, let us <c>cp</c> (or <c>mv</c>, as some would prefer not to keep the original file with the same name since it has been backed up) <b>finder_v00.sh</b> to <b>q01.sh</b> as your working copy for accomplishing the required modifications. \r\n\r\n<ul id=\"check\">\r\n<li> <c>cp</c> or <c>mv</c> finder_v00.sh to q01.sh.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h4> 1.2 Conditional Redirection </h4>\r\n<p> We want to run and read the scripts to learn about catching user input and redirection.

In our case, we have two short scripts (<b>user_input.sh</b> and </b>redirect.sh</b>) in the q01 directory, they provide examples of how to implement the changes you need.

The <c>-n</c> instructs the shell not to output the trailing newline.\r\n<li> Line #8 is an input (<c>read</c>) line that takes \"<b>name</b>\" as variable. \r\n<li> Line # 9 is another echo line that prints out the message we want.

When we do <c>.redirect.sh</c> and follow the prompt to enter a01.txt, which is a file we know exists in each question directory, we see:\r\n<pre>\r\nchen_user2@vma50:~/class/a03/q01$ ./redirect.sh \r\nPlease enter a filename: a01.txt\r\nchen_user2@vma50:~/class/a03/q01$ ls\r\n</pre>\r\n<p> The file did not give us any further feedback.  However, if we <c>ls</c> the directory, we see an additional file, <b>success.log</b>:\r\n<pre>\r\na01.bak  check01.sh  finder.in      redirect.sh  user_input.sh\r\na01.txt  error.log   finder_v00.sh  success.log </pre>\r\n<p> Now let\'s take a look at the content of success.log: \r\n<pre>\r\nchen_user2@vma50:~/class/a03/q01$ cat success.log \r\nThis file logs commands that succeed\r\na01.txt\r\nWe looked for file a01.txt\r\nchen_user2@vma50:~/class/a03/q01$ \r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p> Obviously, script <c>redirect.sh</c> redirected some text into the file success.log.  Now let us take a look at the content of the script:\r\n<pre>\r\n01 #!/bin/bash\r\n02 \r\n03 # This script provides a simple example of how to redirect output resulting\r\n04 # from commands that execute properly and commands that do not.   \r\n05 \r\n06 ##### prompt (-n: no newline) and input->variable \r\n07 echo -n \"Please enter a filename: \"\r\n08 read name\r\n09\r\n10 ##### echo text stream and redirect \r\n11 echo \"This file logs commands that succeed\" > success.log\r\n12 echo \"This file logs commands that fail (except this one)\" > error.log\r\n13\r\n14 ########## Conditional Redirection ##########\r\n15 ### If $name is found, the ls $name command succeeds and \r\n16 ###    the command output will go into the success.log file.\r\n17 ### If $name is not found, the \"not found\" output goes into error.log\r\n18 ls $name 1>> success.log 2>> error.log; \r\n19 \r\n20 ########## Conditional Redirection ##########\r\n21 ### If $name is found, the \"echo $name\" command succeeds and \r\n22 ###    its output will go into the success.log file.\r\n23 ### If $name is not found, the \"not found\" message goes into error.log.\r\n24 echo \"We looked for file $name\" 1>> success.log 2>> error.log\r\n25\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p> From the redirection.sh code above, we see that:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> Line #7 is an echo line that prompts user for input.\r\n<li> Line #8 takes the user input from STDIN and save it to a variable called <b>name</b>.\r\n<li> Line #11 and 12, we see that this script actually produced two files: success.log and error.log.  These two lines are comment messages into each of the two log files and they are overwrite redirection so, when run each time, they will create the two new files of success.log and error.log.\r\n<li> As line #14 and #20 say, line #18 and line #24 perform <b>conditional redirection</b>.  When the command succeeds, <c>1>></c> takes effect.  When the command fails, <c>2>></c> takes effect.  This \"conditional\" action is achieved in line #18 and 24 by using <b>file descriptor</b>(<c>1</c> and <c>2</c>) along with redirection operator <c>>></c>.\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<li> <a href=\"https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/file-descriptor.htm\">File descriptor</a> </li>\r\n<p> A file descriptor (or, file handle) is a unique number that points to a data source (file being used by the OS).  The first three file descriptor are of most interest to us:\r\n<table id=\"tbl_regular\">\r\n<thead><tr> <th> File Descriptor   </th>  <th>  Name </th>  <th> Abreviation  </th> </tr></thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr> <td> 0 </td>  <td> Standard Input  </td>  <td> STDIN  </td> </tr>\r\n<tr> <td> 1 </td>  <td> Standard Output  </td>  <td> STDOUT  </td> </tr>\r\n<tr> <td> 2  </td>  <td> Standard Error  </td>  <td> STDERR  </td> </tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n\r\n<p> Graphically, these three standard data streams work like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams\">this</a>:\r\n<img src=\"../images/std_streams.png\" height=\"200\">\r\n\r\n<p> For example, on line #18, <c>ls $name 1>> success.log 2>> error.log;</c> (note that the command separator<c>;</c> at the end of line can be omitted when a line break follows), we see that the command is <c>ls $name</c>.  <c>$name</c> performs <a href=\"https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/varsubn.html\">variable substitution</a> to reference to the content of variable <b>name</b>.  In our case above, we give a01.txt at the read prompt, so the value of $name is \"a01.txt\", which is a file that exists.  Therefore, the shell will output the successful listing result to STDOUT, which we then redirect to success.log; and the <c>2>> error.log</c> part is ignored.  In the case that the file does not exist, ls $name will result in an error, which will be sent to STDOUT as well, and we redirect it to error.log by using <c>2>> error.log</c>, and the <c>1>></c> part is ignored.\r\n\r\n<p> In line# 17 and 18 of <c>redirect.sh</c>, we use redirection operator <c>>></c> to direct the text stream to files and we use file descriptors (fd) number 1 (STDOUT, can be omitted) and 2 (STDERR) to point to the data source.  This creates a <b>conditional redirection</b> much like a short-hand for if statement.  \r\n\r\n<ul id=check>\r\n<li> Use nano to open redirect.sh and examine the code closely.  Make sure you understand how <b>conditional redirection</b> works using <b>file descriptor</b> 1 and 2. \r\n</ul>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h4> 1.3 Create Conditional Redirection </h4>\r\n<p> With our understanding in user input and <b>conditional redirection</b>, we are ready to modify the script file q01.sh.  \r\n\r\n<ol class=\"upper_case\">\r\n<li> Run q01.sh:\r\n<p> Before we modify it, let us run <c>./q01.sh</c> to take a look at the results.  We get:\r\n<pre>\r\nchen_user@vma50:~/class/a03/q01$ ./q01.sh \r\nOK, This is a list of where bin was found\r\nOh no!  bin wasn\'t found here.\r\nFound bin\r\nDid NOT find bin\r\nls: cannot access \'/home/admindean/bin\': No such file or directory\r\nls: cannot access \'/home/administrator/bin\': No such file or directory\r\nls: cannot access \'/home/chen_admin/bin\': No such file or directory\r\n4 /home/chen_user/bin\r\nls: cannot access \'/home/chen_user2/bin\': No such file or directory\r\nls: cannot access \'/home/chen_user3/bin\': No such file or directory\r\nls: cannot access \'/home/test/bin\': No such file or directory\r\nls: cannot access \'/home/test2/bin\': No such file or directory\r\nls: cannot access \'/home/test3/bin\': No such file or directory\r\nls: cannot access \'/home/test_user/bin\': No such file or directory\r\nchen_user@vma50:~/class/a03/q01$ \r\n</pre>\r\n<p> We don\'t always want the output to be displayed on the screen like this.  Log files will be preferred in most cases when we perform administrative tasks because they are easier to read, process, and retrieve.\r\n \r\n<li> Check out the code \r\n<p>  Now we <c>nano q01.sh</c> and see the script looks like this:\r\n<pre>\r\n01 #!/bin/bash       \r\n02 # Check to see if we have an aliases file.  If so, execute it\r\n03 #\r\n04 if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ] ; then\r\n05         shopt -s expand_aliases\r\n06         source ~/.bash_aliases\r\n07 fi\r\n08 ###\r\n09 ### Now look for implemented files \r\n10 ###     (bin, class, tmp and public_html are good examples)\r\n11 ### Right now this is set to look for the \"bin\" file, \r\n12 ###     you will change this accept user input\r\n13\r\n14 # echo \"What file would you like to look for (good choices are bin, test, and public_html)\"  \r\n15 file=\"bin\"              # use bin as the default to start, we really want to read this from the terminal\r\n16 \r\n17 echo \"OK, This is a list of where $file was found\"      # This should output to success.log\r\n18 echo \"Oh no!  $file wasn\'t found here.\"                 # This should output to error.log\r\n19\r\n20 echo \"Found $file\"                                      # This should output to success.log\r\n21 echo \"Did NOT find $file\"                               # This should output to error.log\r\n22 \r\n23 for homedir in /home/*; do\r\n24     ls --directory --size \"$homedir/$file\"       # This output should go to success.log (if found) or error.log (if not found)\r\n25 done\r\n</pre>\r\n<p> We see that line #1 is a shebang, #2~7 is an if statement that checks if there\'s a .bash_aliases file in your home directory, and <c>source</c> (execute and keep the variables in the current session).  By default, aliases are not available in scripts, so we need to use the shell option command <c>shopt</c> to make them available here in this script.  This part of the code is for later when we are going to create some aliases in a03/q02 and we will re-use this piece of code in a03/q03 and this piece of code will become useful.  For example, the <b>accounts</b> alias we created in h03/q02 would then can be used in scripts, not just in command line (yes, even it\'s put in ~./bash_aliases).  With this, you can use that alias in place of the <c>ls</c> command in line #24.  Don\'t worry if you don\'t have this set up.  We will cover this topic later. \r\n<p> Line #14 is commented out but it has a command <c>echo</c> in there.  It would be interesting to see what will happen if we uncomment it.  Line #17 to 21 are redirections; and line #23 to 25 is a for loop.  We can move on to modify this piece of code by performing the following tasks: \r\n\r\n<li> Enable user input: \r\n<p> Modify q01.sh so that it will:\r\n<ul id=check>\r\n    <li> Enable user prompt:\r\n<p> Modify the code (#14) so that it will prompt for the user to input a file name (everything is a file in Unix-like systems; directories are files, too) to find.  In this script, we are suggested to monitor the directories that we have created under the user home, which is a good idea since we know for sure if they exist or not. \r\n    <li> Enable user input:\r\n<p> To take user input, we use the <c>read</c> command, which will scan STDIN for user input from keyboard.  Right now, the input is hardcoded to default to the bin directory, which is not what we want.  We want the script to take user input so it can search the existence of any files for us.  Modify line #15 can help us achieve this purpose. \r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<li> Set up redirection: \r\n<ul id=check>\r\n<li> Simple redirectioin:\r\n<p> Modify line #17, 18, 20, and 21 to properly redirect text streams to the log files.  The messages would go into the right logs as specified in the comments after the commands. \r\n\r\n<li> Conditional redirection:\r\n<p> The for-loop <c>for homedir in /home/*</c> will parse through directory /home and assign each of the filenames (user directory, in this case) the <b>loop variable</b> <c>homedir</c> (home directory).  Each of the user home directories will then be listed for $file (<c>ls $homedir/$file</c>) since it is the command that the loop asks to <c>do</c>.  After all elements (names of the user home directory) are iterated, the loop is \"<c>done</c>.\"  \r\n<p> If the user of this script input \"bin\" for search, then since only some of the user accounts have the bin directory created in user home, some <c>ls $homedir/bin/</c> will be successful and some will say \"No such file or directory\".  Here our job is to modify the line of command (line #24) inside the loop so that the <c>ls</c> results  will be <b>conditionally</b> sent to either error.log or success.log.  The rules of the conditional redirection is as discussed above:\r\n<ul class=\"circle\">\r\n    <li> Any standard (successful) output (STDOUT) messages are redirected to the file success.log\r\n    <li> Any error output (STDERR) messages are redirected to the file error.log\r\n</ul>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h4 > Check Your Work </h4>\r\n<ul><ul id=\"check\">\r\n<li>	Make a copy of the working script q01.sh as finder_v01.sh to the backup directory. \r\n    <p>Once this script is working as you check the logs are correctly created, save a copy of q01.sh in your ~/backup directory as <b>finder_v01.sh</b>.  \r\n<li>	Modify a01.txt: You know what to do. \r\n<li>	Run the check script to see how you have done in this Part.  \r\n</ul></ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> \"In UNIX (and therefore Linux), everything is a file.\"  So regular text files, directories, text/data streams, or even peripherals (device files), are treated as files by the operating system.  In this regard, STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR are treated as files and each given a file descriptor (fd).  If you are intrigued by this statement, check out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file\">Wikipedia</a> and other sources to dig deeper.  For example, what does this statement mean in the <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/117939/htg-explains-what-everything-is-a-file-means-on-linux/\">file system</a>?  And what does it mean from the perspective of <a href=\"https://ph7spot.com/musings/in-unix-everything-is-a-file\">data stream and name space</a>?  As you may find out, technology can be philosophically amazing. ^^\r\n<li> When the operating system opens a \"file\", a file descriptor is assigned to it so that the open file is kept in track.  In C language, it is called a file handle.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                   ', '', '', '', 'Conditional Redirection', 0),
(1017, 'lab', 3, 2, '   <p> The idea here is that you are creating your own working environment. The aliases and environment variables you are creating here are administrative tools common for IT workplace.  Common places for configuring Linux environment include the .bashrc and .profile files under the user home directory.  In Ubuntu ~/.bashrc, it is suggested to use ~/.bash_aliases to include additional aliases. \r\n\r\n<p> There are three levels of working environment settings (may consist of aliases, environment variables such as paths, and scripts) that we may want to define to make our jobs easier:\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li> Local level: <c>source</c> on demand\r\n    <p> When you have a defined environment file that you want to use only when running certain tasks.  For example, every week you need to monitor and backup certain log files involving long path names and routine file processing such as copying and moving files into some directories and add a log record for completing the tasks.  You <c>source</c> the file when you need that environment. \r\n    <li> User level: execute when log in (use <c>~/.bash_aliases</c> for aliases and <c>~/.profile</c> for PATH):\r\n    <p> When you have a defined environment that you use regularly and you want to make it available every time you log into the shell.  When you log in, .bashrc will run .bash_aliases if exists.

To accomplish that we will: \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> define some paths and aliases so that later we can see the output of q01.sh from any directory yet at the same time not creating the success.log and error.log files in every directory we run the script, and  \r\n<li> define some aliases so that we can see the output of q01.sh from any directory yet at the same time not create the success.log and error.log files in every directory. </ol>\r\n\r\n <ul>\r\n<li>Use the directory ~/class/a03/q02 to record your answers for this part of the assignment. </ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4> 2.1 Create Environment Variables</h4> \r\n<ol class=upper_casse>\r\n<li> Define the ENV\r\n<p> To help us do this with less typing, define the environment variables for your ~/tmp and ~/class/a03 directories as follows:\r\n      export A3=$HOME/class/a03\r\n<li> Create the env file\r\n   <p> Change to your home directory and use nano to create a file called myenv.  Within myenv insert five bash commands that define:\r\n    <ol> \r\n    <li> an environment variable called MYTMP that represents your ~/tmp directory and a second environment variable that represents your ~/class/a03 directory.

One of the simplest is to create a file naming convention and a directory structure that helps you and programs find and identify files easily.  More advanced techniques use metadata (repositories of data about the data) stored in other files or databases to help you quickly identify and access files.  Often, databases are used to manage some or all of the data.  In cases where a very large amount of data is being managed, an automated management system becomes necessary.  Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages â€“ and each creates the need for careful management of the information and systems being used.\r\n\r\n<p> In this activity, you will learn some of the basics of administering MySQL, creating databases and tables, and using batch files that enable you to move the data from a structured text file into a database.  While it might be tempting to think that one should employ a graphical interface such as MySQL Workbench or PHPMyAdmin to manage the database, there are many instances where data and database operations need to be completed without human intervention.  In these cases, understanding the underlying technology and systems behind databases is critical to the efficient operation of an information system.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p> This is a complex activity that requires carefully following the directions.  Take your time and work carefully.  Since you are creating a shared database, your group should work on this together.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4> Activities</h4>\r\n<p> For this activity, our goal is to create a database containing several tables.  These tables hold data on dealerships, the owners of the dealerships, the sales agents who work there, and the car sales that were made.  \r\n\r\n<p> In the process of this lab we will:\r\n<ol>  \r\n<li> Set MySQL root password to something you and your partner can remember\r\n<li> Create another account (salesadmin) that you can use to manage the car sales database\r\n<li> Create a user account (salesmgr) that can be used to access the data in the car sales database (but not update or insert additional data into it)\r\n<li> Create the database\r\n<li> Check that the data was inserted into the database correctly\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p> None of this activity matters if the data we put into the table is incorrect.  As a result, we will need to develop a set of tests that can help us determine that the data we have in over 1000 weekly sales files is correctly inserted into the database.   \r\n\r\n<h4> Database Information </h4>\r\n<p> Review the data model and data dictionaries that support this activity and follow the instructions carefully.  You will use them in your lab activities. \r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<p> Figure 1. Data Model <img src=\"../images/a04_0_1.png \"  height=500> </p>\r\n<p> Table 1.

Doing them separately will create a database with multiple entries of the same data.\r\n\r\n<h4> Change MySQL root Password</h4>\r\n<p> This section is an overview of how to change MySQL root password.

This step reads the sales data from the weekly sales reports for each dealership and creates files containing the SQL statements needed to insert that information into the MySQL database.  To complete this step, you will need to run the program annual_sales.pl and provide it with the year of the data to insert (2010 to 2015).  \r\n\r\n<p> The program will ask you for the year and then create a file called salesXXXX.sql (where XXXX is the year) within the sXXXX subdirectory.

Each yearâ€™s data can take up to 8 minutes to insert the 60,000 â€“ 90,000 sales records into the database.  As a result, we will run them as Linux background jobs so that we donâ€™t have to wait for them to complete one year before starting the next year.\r\n\r\n<p> If you have not yet completed Part 1, make sure you go back and do it now before you can perform the database insertion.\r\n\r\n<p> In this part of the lab, we will need access to the sql files that you created in Part 1.
